This Movable Type plugin allows you to use common MT tags to pull in data
that you may want to repeat in more than one place.  As the standard MT
distribution does not provide for any licenses other than Creative Commons, 
I decided that more tags would be most helpful in moving me away from CC.
This plugin is the result.


Installation:

To install, place the 'SomeTags.pl' file in your Movable Type "plugins"
directory.  If you do not have a Movable Type plugins directory, create
one, then put the 'SomeTags.pl' file in it.  Refer to the Movable Type
documentation for more information regarding plugins.

With all modules that you put on your server, make sure that they are
executable.  Permissions of 755 ought to work fine.

Tag information:

  <$MTSTLicenseTitle$> - returns the title of your license
  <$MTSTLicenseURL$> - returns the URL to the details of your license
  <$MTSTLicenseVersion$> - returns the version number of your license

These values are set inside the SomeTags.pl file.  The variables used for
this operation are well documented.  If you can handle notepad, you can
handle setting these tags.  Simply open the file with notepad, read the
instructions, change the values (if necessary) and you're off.

The values for these tags is currently set to the Open Software License,
version 2.0, located at http://www.opensource.org/licenses/osl-2.0.php.  If
you want to use these values, you don't need to edit the plugin.

Here's how you use it:

Simply place any (or all) of the above tags into your Movable Type template
and rebuild the template.  No context is necessary, so you can place these
tags anywhere on any template.
